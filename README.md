Below is a description of the multi-purpose file conversion tool I developed using C#.
This project allows users to convert between various image formats such as JPG, PNG, and ICO, as well as convert DOCX files to PDF. 
I utilized the Spire.Doc and Spire.PDF libraries for seamless interaction with Word and PDF formats.


The interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly, allowing users to easily select files and convert them to the desired format with a single click. 
For example, when a DOCX file is selected and the 'Word to PDF' button is clicked, the name of the selected file is displayed, and the conversion happens instantly. 
Similarly, for image conversions, users can effortlessly switch between formats like JPG to PNG or ICO.


This tool aims to simplify the process of managing visual and document formats, providing quick and efficient conversion operations.
